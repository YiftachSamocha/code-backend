# CodeSync - BackEnd - A Real-Time Code Mentoring Platform

The backend of this application is built with **Node.js** and utilizes **MongoDB** for persistent data storage. It also integrates **Socket.IO** to enable real-time communication between users and mentors. The system is designed to efficiently handle dynamic interactions, such as updating blocks and managing real-time messaging, while ensuring smooth data management.

#### 1. **Block Service**
The `blockService` is responsible for managing block-related data:
- **Get Block by Type:** This function retrieves a block based on its type from the MongoDB database. If no such block exists, the service will load default block data from a JSON file and store it in the database.
- **Update Block:** Allows updating the block's data within the MongoDB collection, ensuring that the database reflects the most current information.
- **Data Creation:** If a block of a specified type is missing, the service will create and insert the default block data into MongoDB, which is sourced from a JSON file stored on the server.

#### 2. **Block Routes and Controller**
API routes are defined to facilitate interaction with the block data:
- **GET /:type:** This route fetches a block based on its type, utilizing the `blockService` to retrieve the data.
- **PUT /:** Allows for the updating of a blockâ€™s data by sending updated information to the server, which is then saved in the database.

#### 3. **Socket Communication**
Real-time interaction is handled using **Socket.IO**, allowing users to dynamically interact with each other:
- **Block Type Management:** Users are assigned specific block types to join real-time rooms for interaction. Mentors and users communicate through these blocks, and real-time events help manage these interactions.
- **Event Handling:** Key events such as editing blocks, sending questions, and receiving answers are handled live. This enables a fluid communication experience between users and mentors.

#### 4. **MongoDB Integration**
**MongoDB** is used as the database solution, offering flexibility with its NoSQL document structure. The backend stores and retrieves blocks and user interactions from the database, supporting the dynamic nature of the application.

#### 5. **Node.js Framework**
The backend leverages **Node.js** with the **Express.js** framework for creating and managing the API endpoints. The integration of **Socket.IO** ensures real-time communication, enabling interactive features such as block updates and user-mentor chat.

### Conclusion

The backend is designed to support both data persistence and real-time interaction, providing a robust foundation for dynamic user engagement. By combining **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Socket.IO**, the application offers efficient data management and responsive, interactive communication, ensuring a seamless experience for users and mentors alike.
